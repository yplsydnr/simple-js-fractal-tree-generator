# simple javascript fractal tree generator
 a simple index.html file that will display a recursively generated tree. the program is entirely contained in the index.html file.

 I had previously uploaded my tree drawing program as a vue.js project, because it's from a larger personal project. But I realised it would be much more useful to condense and move to a simple index.html that can be dragged directly into the browser.
 
 This project is to demonstrate basic use of canvas in HTML, and to have a recursive drawing function, because fractal shapes are cool. This code is also a good starting point for tinkering, and even small changes can cause significant effects. Not all of the trees will look great, but some are pretty good in my opinion. Hope you enjoy!

(click for slightly better quality -- saving these images preserves the exact shape of the tree with no background, so you can easily use the trees in other things.)
