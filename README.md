# simple javascript fractal tree generator
 a simple index.html file that will display a recursively generated tree. the program is entirely contained in the index.html file.

 I had previously uploaded my tree drawing program as a vue.js project, because it's from a larger personal project. But I realised it would be much more useful to condense and move to a simple index.html that can be dragged directly into the browser. Enjoy!

(click for slightly better quality -- saving these images preserves the exact shape of the tree with no background, so you can easily use the trees in other things.)
